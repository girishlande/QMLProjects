This project demonstrates how to use QSetting class to read and write ini files. 

In this project we create listmodel by reading ini file. 
This model is displayed on the view. 
You can update view values and it will reflect the model immediately. 
You can store the updated model in another configuration file. 

For reading and write to the configuration file we use QSettings class.
