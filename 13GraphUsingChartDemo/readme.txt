This project shows demo of how to create interactive graphics on top of the QT charts using canvas tool. 

This project reads some points and draws lines in QT chart. 
User can interactively create some annotations on this graph using dynamic graphics. 
This is kind of cool. Mostly coding is done in javascript in qml files. Very little c++ support
