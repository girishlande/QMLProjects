>Property animation demo: Create a simple rectangle. On clicking that rectangle it should
move from left to right of the window. Clicking again it should move from right to left of the screen.
Keep 2 propertyanimations width different ids. on clicking mousearea of the rectangle start animations alternatively

> RotationAnimation Demo: Create a rectangle and add text in the center. Click on the rectangle to start animation. 
Click again to pause animation. Add RotationAnimation with direction property. 

> Sequential animation Demo: Create a rectangle and add large text in center of it. Rotate text. Clip the text which 
goes out of the rectangle. Add 2 scaleanimators in sequentialAnimation. One scaleanimation will increase size of 
the rectangle and another will shrink size of the rectangle.

> Opacity animation Demo: Add a ghost image on the black background. Add Sequentialanimation and add 2 OpacityAnimators 
in it. One opacityAnimator should change opacity from 0 to 1 and another should change from 1 to 0. Keep duration different.
It should be Spooky :-)

> SmoothedAnimation Demo: Add 2 rectangles. One small and one large. Keep black background. Make one rectangle follow
another rectangle. THis can be done by setting x and y value of rectangle , property bound to another rectangle. 
And Add behavior on x and behavior on y. Inside behavior add SmoothedAnimation{ velocity: 100}

> Antialiasing Demo: Add 2 circles with border width. Make rectangle transparent and keep border width to 20 and color
to red. By default antialiasing will be TRUE. So explicitly make another rectangle opacity false. See the difference.

> Key handling demo: Add 2 rectangles. Make outer one transparent with some border. Now on keys UP,DOWN,RIGHT,LEFT change
size of the inner rectangle and observe how it changes.
