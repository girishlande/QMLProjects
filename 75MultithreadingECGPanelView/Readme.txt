This project will show status bar in the window
clicking on the status bar will show you 3 ECG wave charts
You can scroll to see all.

Status bar has 2 buttons => 1. Maximize 2. Minimize

Clicking on Maximize will hide expanded status bar and show a separate window containing ECG waves.
Clicking on Minimize button will hide scrollbar slowly. 

This is little CPU and memory intensive application. 
It uses multiple threads to update the ECG wave models. 
For each wave there is one worker thread in the background.
